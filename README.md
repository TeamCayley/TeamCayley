### About Team.Cayley 

Team.Cayley(2022.03 ~) is made up of students from [Chung-Ang University](cay.ac.kr) in Korea, majoring in Library and Information Science and [COSADAMA](cosadama.com). With the start of the COVID-19, we began the project titled "COVID-19: Our Memory" and the "Cultural Heritage Synapse" project is in progress. Currently, the third-term members are active and our activities will continue.
